# Claude Code Journal

This journal tracks substantive work on documents, diagrams, and documentation content.

---

1. **Task - Project initialization** (v0.1.0): Initialized Claude Code configuration for new JupyterLab extension project `jupyterlab_camunda_modeller_extension`<br>
   **Result**: Created `.claude/CLAUDE.md` with workspace import directive and project-specific configuration for this BPMN/Camunda modelling extension. Updated `README.md` with proper badges (GitHub Actions, npm, PyPI, JupyterLab 4, KOLOMOLO, PayPal donate), feature list, and streamlined installation instructions. Created this journal with initial entry. Project initialized with `git init -b main` and initial commit containing all artefacts.

2. **Task - BPMN modeller implementation** (v0.1.0): Implemented full BPMN modelling widget using bpmn-js library from Camunda<br>
   **Result**: Created complete BPMN editor implementation following drawio extension patterns. Added `src/widget.ts` with `BpmnWidget` (extends Lumino Widget) and `BpmnFactory` (extends ABCWidgetFactory) classes - widget initializes bpmn-js Modeler with Camunda extension support, handles two-way document sync via `context.model.contentChanged` and `context.saveState` signals, provides empty BPMN template for new files, and includes error handling with user-friendly messages. Created `src/icon.ts` with BPMN LabIcon using Camunda orange (#FC5D0D) SVG showing start->task->end flow. Created `.resources/bpmn.svg` icon file. Updated `src/index.ts` to register `.bpmn` file type with icon, widget factory (readOnly: false for editing), and "Export as SVG" context menu command. Added bpmn-js CSS imports to `style/index.js` for diagram-js, bpmn-js, and bpmn-font stylesheets. Created `style/base.css` with widget styling including dark theme support for canvas background. Updated `package.json` with dependencies: bpmn-js ^18.10.1, camunda-bpmn-moddle ^7.0.1, and required JupyterLab/Lumino packages. Created `src/types.d.ts` with TypeScript declarations for bpmn-js/lib/Modeler and camunda-bpmn-moddle modules.

3. **Task - Bug fixes and refinements** (v0.1.5): Fixed multiple issues with BPMN modeller - TypeScript build, save functionality, styling, and icon registration<br>
   **Result**: Fixed TypeScript build error with lib0 package by adding `skipLibCheck: true` to `tsconfig.json`. Fixed save functionality - changed from async save on `saveState` signal (race condition) to syncing model on every `commandStack.changed` event via new `_syncToModel()` method, ensuring Ctrl+S works reliably. Fixed canvas styling - updated `style/base.css` to use white background (#ffffff) consistently instead of theme variables, with proper contrast for palette and popup elements. Fixed icon registration - moved BPMN icon definition from separate `icon.ts` directly into `index.ts` following drawio extension pattern, using simple name `bpmn:icon` instead of full extension namespace. Removed unused `IFileBrowserFactory` dependency. Added debug logging throughout widget initialization to aid troubleshooting.

4. **Task - Fix BPMN icon display** (v1.0.2): Added schema directory and simplified icon SVG for proper file browser icon display<br>
   **Result**: Investigated why BPMN icon wasn't displaying in file browser. Compared with working extensions (drawio, zip, vscode_icons) and discovered all have `schema/plugin.json` file with `"schemaDir": "schema"` in package.json jupyterlab section. Created `schema/plugin.json` with `jupyter.lab.setting-icon: bpmn:icon` settings. Added `"schemaDir": "schema"` to `package.json` jupyterlab section. Initially tried using complex SVG from `.resources/bpmn.svg` but paths were too complex for LabIcon rendering. Simplified to use cleaner SVG with basic elements (path for rounded background, circles for start/end events, rect for task, path for gateway diamond) matching the proven pattern from vscode_icons extension. Icon uses Camunda orange (#fc5d0d) with white BPMN symbols.

5. **Task - CI/CD and GitHub setup** (v1.0.2): Configured GitHub repository and CI/CD workflows using jupyter-releaser<br>
   **Result**: Added GitHub remote origin and pushed initial codebase. Updated `package.json` with correct GitHub URLs for homepage, bugs, and repository fields. Created `.github/workflows/` with four workflow files following JUPYTERLAB_EXTENSION.md patterns: `build.yml` (main CI with lint, build, test_isolated, check_links jobs), `check-release.yml` (release verification with RH_SINCE_LAST_STABLE and steps_to_skip build-changelog), `prep-release.yml` (manual workflow dispatch for release preparation), `publish-release.yml` (triggered on release publish, deploys to npm and PyPI using secrets). Added screenshot to README above Features section.

6. **Task - Color picker and styling fixes** (v1.0.4): Added element color picker feature and fixed dim context menu styling<br>
   **Result**: Integrated `bpmn-js-color-picker` module (installed via npm) to enable element coloring like Camunda Modeler. Updated `src/widget.ts` to include `BpmnColorPickerModule` in `additionalModules` array. Added TypeScript declaration in `src/types.d.ts` for the module. Added CSS import in `style/index.js` for color-picker.css. Fixed dim context pad and popup styling in `style/base.css` - added `opacity: 1 !important` and `color: #333 !important` rules for `.djs-context-pad .entry`, `.djs-popup .entry`, and `[class*='bpmn-icon-']` selectors to override default dim styling. Reorganized CSS to fix stylelint `no-descending-specificity` errors - moved all base `.entry` selectors before `:hover` and `::before` pseudo variants, grouped by container (context-pad, palette, popup) with section comments.

7. **Task - Popup positioning fix and UI tests** (v1.0.7): Fixed color picker popup positioning using MutationObserver and added Galata UI tests<br>
   **Result**: Investigated color picker popup appearing far from cursor - caused by `position: fixed` inside JupyterLab containers with CSS transforms. Initial CSS fix didn't work because popup-parent was still inside transformed container. Implemented JavaScript solution using MutationObserver in `src/widget.ts` - `_setupPopupObserver()` watches for `.djs-popup-parent` elements being added to the container and moves them to `document.body` for correct fixed positioning. Added cleanup in `dispose()` to disconnect observer and remove orphaned popup elements. Added corresponding CSS rules in `style/base.css` for `body > .djs-popup-parent .djs-popup` selectors with stylelint-disable comment for no-descending-specificity rule since these target different DOM contexts. Created comprehensive Galata UI tests in `ui-tests/tests/jupyterlab_camunda_modeller_extension.spec.ts`: test for opening BPMN diagram (creates test file via API, opens via file browser double-click, verifies `.jp-BpmnWidget`, `.djs-container`, canvas SVG, and start event element), test for Ctrl+S save (opens file, optionally adds task via palette, presses Ctrl+S, verifies no dirty indicator on tab, reads file back via API to confirm valid BPMN XML content).

8. **Task - Realign Connectors command** (v1.0.9): Added context menu command to widen text annotations and re-route association connectors with border-snapping<br>
   **Result**: Implemented "Realign Connectors" feature to fix misaligned BPMN diagrams. Added TypeScript type declarations in `src/types.d.ts` for bpmn-js services: `IShape` (element with id, type, bounds, businessObject.text), `IConnection` (association with source/target/waypoints), `IBounds`, `IWaypoint`, `IElementRegistry.filter()`, and `IModeling.resizeShape()`/`layoutConnection()`/`updateWaypoints()`. Added `realignConnectors()` method in `src/widget.ts` that gets `modeling` and `elementRegistry` services from modeler, finds all `bpmn:TextAnnotation` elements, calculates required width based on text length (7px per character, min 100px, max 400px), resizes annotations using `modeling.resizeShape()`. For associations, implemented proper waypoint calculation with border-snapping: `_getShapeCenter()` calculates shape center points, `_getBorderIntersection()` uses ray-casting to find intersection point on rectangular shape border along line from inside to outside point - checks all four edges (left, right, top, bottom) and returns closest intersection. Updates association waypoints using `modeling.updateWaypoints()` with calculated border intersection points so connectors snap cleanly to shape edges. Registered new command `bpmn:realign-connectors` in `src/index.ts` with label "Realign Connectors", added to context menu at rank 2 below "Export as SVG". Created checkpoint tag `CHECKPOINT_BEFORE_REALIGN_CONNECTORS_1.0.9` before implementation.
