This journal tracks substantive work on documents, diagrams, and documentation content.

1. **Task - Project initialization** (v0.1.0): Initialized Claude Code configuration for new JupyterLab extension project `jupyterlab_camunda_modeller_extension`<br>
   **Result**: Created `.claude/CLAUDE.md` with workspace import directive and project-specific configuration for this BPMN/Camunda modelling extension. Updated `README.md` with proper badges (GitHub Actions, npm, PyPI, JupyterLab 4, KOLOMOLO, PayPal donate), feature list, and streamlined installation instructions. Created this journal with initial entry. Project initialized with `git init -b main` and initial commit containing all artefacts.
