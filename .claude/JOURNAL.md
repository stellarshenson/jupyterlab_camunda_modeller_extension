# Claude Code Journal

This journal tracks substantive work on documents, diagrams, and documentation content.

---

1. **Task - Project initialization** (v0.1.0): Initialized Claude Code configuration for new JupyterLab extension project `jupyterlab_camunda_modeller_extension`<br>
   **Result**: Created `.claude/CLAUDE.md` with workspace import directive and project-specific configuration for this BPMN/Camunda modelling extension. Updated `README.md` with proper badges (GitHub Actions, npm, PyPI, JupyterLab 4, KOLOMOLO, PayPal donate), feature list, and streamlined installation instructions. Created this journal with initial entry. Project initialized with `git init -b main` and initial commit containing all artefacts.

2. **Task - BPMN modeller implementation** (v0.1.0): Implemented full BPMN modelling widget using bpmn-js library from Camunda<br>
   **Result**: Created complete BPMN editor implementation following drawio extension patterns. Added `src/widget.ts` with `BpmnWidget` (extends Lumino Widget) and `BpmnFactory` (extends ABCWidgetFactory) classes - widget initializes bpmn-js Modeler with Camunda extension support, handles two-way document sync via `context.model.contentChanged` and `context.saveState` signals, provides empty BPMN template for new files, and includes error handling with user-friendly messages. Created `src/icon.ts` with BPMN LabIcon using Camunda orange (#FC5D0D) SVG showing start->task->end flow. Created `.resources/bpmn.svg` icon file. Updated `src/index.ts` to register `.bpmn` file type with icon, widget factory (readOnly: false for editing), and "Export as SVG" context menu command. Added bpmn-js CSS imports to `style/index.js` for diagram-js, bpmn-js, and bpmn-font stylesheets. Created `style/base.css` with widget styling including dark theme support for canvas background. Updated `package.json` with dependencies: bpmn-js ^18.10.1, camunda-bpmn-moddle ^7.0.1, and required JupyterLab/Lumino packages. Created `src/types.d.ts` with TypeScript declarations for bpmn-js/lib/Modeler and camunda-bpmn-moddle modules.

3. **Task - Bug fixes and refinements** (v0.1.5): Fixed multiple issues with BPMN modeller - TypeScript build, save functionality, styling, and icon registration<br>
   **Result**: Fixed TypeScript build error with lib0 package by adding `skipLibCheck: true` to `tsconfig.json`. Fixed save functionality - changed from async save on `saveState` signal (race condition) to syncing model on every `commandStack.changed` event via new `_syncToModel()` method, ensuring Ctrl+S works reliably. Fixed canvas styling - updated `style/base.css` to use white background (#ffffff) consistently instead of theme variables, with proper contrast for palette and popup elements. Fixed icon registration - moved BPMN icon definition from separate `icon.ts` directly into `index.ts` following drawio extension pattern, using simple name `bpmn:icon` instead of full extension namespace. Removed unused `IFileBrowserFactory` dependency. Added debug logging throughout widget initialization to aid troubleshooting.

4. **Task - Fix BPMN icon display** (v1.0.2): Added schema directory and simplified icon SVG for proper file browser icon display<br>
   **Result**: Investigated why BPMN icon wasn't displaying in file browser. Compared with working extensions (drawio, zip, vscode_icons) and discovered all have `schema/plugin.json` file with `"schemaDir": "schema"` in package.json jupyterlab section. Created `schema/plugin.json` with `jupyter.lab.setting-icon: bpmn:icon` settings. Added `"schemaDir": "schema"` to `package.json` jupyterlab section. Initially tried using complex SVG from `.resources/bpmn.svg` but paths were too complex for LabIcon rendering. Simplified to use cleaner SVG with basic elements (path for rounded background, circles for start/end events, rect for task, path for gateway diamond) matching the proven pattern from vscode_icons extension. Icon uses Camunda orange (#fc5d0d) with white BPMN symbols.

5. **Task - CI/CD and GitHub setup** (v1.0.2): Configured GitHub repository and CI/CD workflows using jupyter-releaser<br>
   **Result**: Added GitHub remote origin and pushed initial codebase. Updated `package.json` with correct GitHub URLs for homepage, bugs, and repository fields. Created `.github/workflows/` with four workflow files following JUPYTERLAB_EXTENSION.md patterns: `build.yml` (main CI with lint, build, test_isolated, check_links jobs), `check-release.yml` (release verification with RH_SINCE_LAST_STABLE and steps_to_skip build-changelog), `prep-release.yml` (manual workflow dispatch for release preparation), `publish-release.yml` (triggered on release publish, deploys to npm and PyPI using secrets). Added screenshot to README above Features section.
